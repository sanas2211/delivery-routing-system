 Intelligent Delivery Routing System

A graph-based system to compute delivery routes using **Dijkstra's Algorithm** for shortest path and **BFS traversal** for multi-point delivery simulation.

---

Features
- Dijkstra's Algorithm for optimal path
- BFS for simulated delivery routes
- Adjacency list graph representation
- Priority Queue via `heapq`

-----

sample output
Shortest distances from Warehouse:
Warehouse: 0 units
CityA: 4 units
CityB: 2 units
CityC: 3 units
CityD: 9 units

Delivery Route (BFS Traversal):
Warehouse -> CityA -> CityB -> CityC -> CityD
